Authentication
Now that you have a Client ID and Client Secret you will be authenticating as a Twitch Developer using Oauth2.
Detailed information can be found in the Twitch Developer Docs.

Make a POST request to https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token with the following query string parameters, substituting your Client ID and Client Secret accordingly.

client_id=Client ID

client_secret=Client Secret

grant_type=client_credentials

Example
If your Client ID is abcdefg12345 and your Client Secret is hijklmn67890, the whole url should look like the following.

POST: https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token?client_id=abcdefg12345&client_secret=hijklmn67890&grant_type=client_credentials
The response from this will be a json object containing the access token and the number of second until the token expires.

{
  "access_token": "access12345token",
  "expires_in": 5587808,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
Note: The expires_in shows you the number of seconds before the access_token will expire and must be refreshed.
Requests
Most of the requests to the API will use the POST method
The base URL is: https://api.igdb.com/v4
You define which endpoint you wish to query by appending /{endpoint name} to the base URL eg. https://api.igdb.com/v4/games
Include your Client ID and Access Token in the HEADER of your request so that your headers look like the following.
Take special care of the capitalisation. Bearer should be hard-coded infront of your access_token
Client-ID: Client ID
Authorization: Bearer access_token
You use the BODY of your request to specify the fields you want to retrieve as well as any other filters, sorting etc
Example
If your Client ID is abcdefg12345 and your access_token is access12345token, a simple request to get information about 10 games would be.

POST: https://api.igdb.com/v4/games
Client-ID: abcdefg12345
Authorization: Bearer access12345token
Body: "fields *;"
Note: If you are trying to make these requests via the Browser you will run into CORS errors as the API does not allow requests directly from browsers. You can read more about CORS and how to go around this issue in the CORS Proxy section
More Examples
You can find some examples requests here

Rate Limits
There is a rate limit of 4 requests per second. If you go over this limit you will receive a response with status code 429 Too Many Requests.

You are able to have up to 8 open requests at any moment in time. This can occur if requests take longer than 1 second to respond when multiple requests are being made.

A very basic example to retrieve the name for 10 games.
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

fields name; limit 10;
Get all information from a specific game
1942, is the ID of a game.

https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

fields *; where id = 1942;
Exclude irrelevant data from your query
Remove alternative_name from your result query

https://api.igdb.com/v4/platforms/

fields *;
exclude alternative_name;
Get all games from specific genres
Notice how you can comma separate multiple IDs (8, 9, and 11). You can do this with games, companies and anything else. Also note that when you have multiple IDs they have to be surrounded by a parenthesis. Single ids can be queried both with and without the parenthesis.

https://api.igdb.com/v4/genres/

fields *; where id = (8,9,11);
Count total games that have a rating higher than 75
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/count

where rating > 75;
Order by rating
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

fields name,rating; sort rating desc;
Coming soon games for Playstation 4
https://api.igdb.com/v4/release_dates/

fields *; where game.platforms = 48 & date > 1538129354; sort date asc;
1538129354: Is the timestamp in milliseconds of 28/09/2018 (This you need to generate yourself) 48 Is the platform id of Playstation 4.

Recently released games for Playstation 4
fields *; where game.platforms = 48 & date < 1538129354; sort date desc;
Note: "where game.platforms = 48 & date > 1538129354" It is possible to use either & (AND) or | (OR) to combine filters to better define the behaviour of your query
Search, return certain fields.
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

search "Halo"; fields name,release_date.human;
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

fields name, involved_companies; search "Halo";
Search games but exclude versions (editions)
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

fields name, involved_companies; search "Assassins Creed"; where version_parent = null;
This will return search results with ID and name of the game but exclude editions such as “Collectors Edition”.

Searching all endpoints
Note: Search is now also it's own endpoint. Search is usable on: Characters, Collections, Games, Platforms, and Themes
The example below searches for “Sonic the Hedgehog” which will find the Character Sonic, the collection Soninc the Hedgehog. And of course also several games with names containing Sonic the Hedgehog.

https://api.igdb.com/v4/search

fields *; search "sonic the hedgehog"; limit 50;
Get versions (editions) of a game
https://api.igdb.com/v4/game_versions/

fields game.name,games.name; where game = 28540;
The resulting object will contain all games that are a version of the game with id 28540

Get the parent game for a version
https://api.igdb.com/v4/games/

fields version_parent.*; where id = 39047;
The resulting object will contain all main games

Get all games that are playstation 4 exclusives
fields name,category,platforms;
where category = 0 & platforms = 48;
Get all games that are only released on playstation 4 AND PC
fields name,category,platforms;
where category = 0 & platforms = {48,6};

You can check the current popularity types we support. to do so feel free to query the api /popularity-types. More details can be found under Popularity Types

How to use Popularity API
Start by discovering the available popularity types mentioned above

curl 'https://api.igdb.com/v4/popularity_types' \
-d 'fields name,popularity_source,updated_at; sort id asc;' \
-H 'Client-ID: Client ID' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer access_token' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
Result:

[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"popularity_source": 121,
		"name": "Visits",
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"popularity_source": 121,
		"name": "Want to Play",
	},
	{
		"id": 3,
		"popularity_source": 121,
		"name": "Playing",
	},
	{
		"id": 4,
		"popularity_source": 121,
		"name": "Played",
	},
	{
		"id": 5,
		"popularity_source": 1,
		"name": "24hr Peak Players",
	},
	{
		"id": 6,
		"popularity_source": 1,
		"name": "Postitive Reviews",
	},
	{
		"id": 7,
		"popularity_source": 1,
		"name": "Negative Reviews",
	},
	{
		"id": 8,
		"popularity_source": 1,
		"name": "Total Reviews",
	}
]
Below you can find some example use case of how you can use popularity primitives

Use case 1:
As an API user I’d like to fetch the top 10 games based on IGDB visits.

Query:

curl 'https://api.igdb.com/v4/popularity_primitives' \
-d 'fields game_id,value,popularity_type; sort value desc; limit 10; where popularity_type = 1;' \
-H 'Client-ID: Client ID' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer access_token' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
Result:

[
  {
    "id": 15456,
    "game_id": 121,
    "popularity_type": 1,
    "value": 0.006605335786569
  },
  {
    "id": 16211,
    "game_id": 1244,
    "popularity_type": 1,
    "value": 0.005482980680773
  },
...
  {
    "id": 33353,
    "game_id": 135400,
    "popularity_type": 1,
    "value": 0.002741490340386
  },
  {
    "id": 17317,
    "game_id": 3277,
    "popularity_type": 1,
    "value": 0.002695492180313
  }
]
In the preview of the result above you can see that the top game is the game with IGDB ID 121. https://www.igdb.com/games/minecraft # ID 121

Use case 2:
Define your own trend metrics. For example, by combining two or more primitives with equal or different weight ratios, you can create a unique popularity metric and ensure it fits your needs.

In our use case here we want to combine “Want to play” with a weight of 0.6 and “Playing” with a remaining weight of 0.4.

For each game we would need to calculate this in a matter of: 0.6 * (“Want to play” -> value) + 0.4 * (“Playing” -> value) = custom_popularity_value

To do that you would have to pull the values for each popularity type in your own system and then combine them accordingly.

To pull the date you’ll need locally a data structure similar to the existing popularity primitive where it will have the attributes.

game_id, popularity_type, value The Want to Play maps to the popularity_type = 2 while Playing = 3

An example SQL query that would give you the top 100 of your custom_popularity would be

SELECT igdb_game_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN popularity_type_id = '2' THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS value1,
       SUM(CASE WHEN popularity_type_id = '3' THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS value2,
       (
           0.6 * SUM(CASE WHEN popularity_type_id = '2' THEN value ELSE 0 END) +
           0.4 * SUM(CASE WHEN popularity_type_id = '3' THEN value ELSE 0 END)
           )  AS weighted_score
FROM popularity_primitives
GROUP BY igdb_game_id
ORDER BY weighted_score DESC LIMIT 10;
You can find detailed API documentation under Popularity Types and Popularity Primitives

Webhooks
What?
Webhooks allow us to push data to you when it is added, updated, or deleted. Instead of polling the API for changes, you can listen on your own HTTP endpoint (Webhook) and we will deliver the data to you.

Using Webhooks will ensure that your data is always up to date!

curl -X POST 'https://api.igdb.com/v4/ENDPOINT/webhooks/' \
-d 'url=YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL&secret=YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET&method=create' \
-H 'Client-ID: Client ID' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer access_token' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
How to register your webhook
To register a new webhook you need to send a POST request to ENDPOINT/webhooks. The endpoint is required as it specifies what type of data you want from your webhook.

The post request should contain x-www-form-urlencoded body with three parameters:

url this is your prepared url that is ready to accept data from us.
method this is the type of data you are expecting to your url, there are three types of methods
create, sends new items from the API
delete, sends deleted items from the API
update, sends updated items from the API
secret this is your “secret” password for your webhook. Every request from the webhook service will have your secret in the header called X-Secret.
// Example response upon registering your webhook
{ 
    "id": WEBHOOK_ID, // A unique ID for the webhook
    "url": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL", // Your chosen URL
    "category": 1, // Based on the endpoint you chose
    "sub_category": 0, // Based on your method (can be 0, 1, 2)
    "active": true, // Is the webhook currently active
    "api_key": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Displays the api key the webhook is connected to
    "secret": "YOUR_SECRET", // Your chosen secret
    "created_at": "2018-11-25T23:00:00.000Z", // Created at date
    "updated_at": "2018-11-25T23:00:00.000Z" // Updated at date
}

Registering your webhook in Postman Once your webhook is registered you will receive a response with the new webhook object

// Delete Response from Webhook
{
  "id": "1234"
}
That’s it!
The data will now be sent to your webhook in the body of a post request. The data is a single json object representing an unexpanded entity.
Webhooks from DELETE do not send the entire object but only the ID.

Tip! Always validate your received data with you secret!
Webhooks have an active field, as you can see in the JSON response above, The service will keep the webhook active as long as the webhook url is capable of receiving data from the service. If the url fails 5 times the webhook will be set to inactive (active: false) and the service will stop to send data to this webhook.

Reactivating the webhook is done by re-registering it, this will update the active status to true.

Tip! Re-register your webhook on service start, to make sure it's always active!
# Get ALL registered Webhooks
curl 'https://api.igdb.com/v4/webhooks/' \
-H 'Client-ID: Client ID' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer access_token'
Viewing your webhooks
You can always get information about your webhooks from the API. To get ALL of your registered webhooks simply send a GET request to /webhooks, without the endpoint. This will return a JSON array of your webhooks

To get information about a specific webhook you can make a GET request with the webhook id to /webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID, without the endpoint. This will return the webhook of that id.

curl -X DELETE 'https://api.igdb.com/v4/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID' \
-H 'Client-ID: Client ID' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer access_token'
Removing a Webhook
To remove your existing webhook you need to send a DELETE request to /webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID, without the endpoint. The Webhook id is returned during the registration process or can be found with a GET request to /webhooks/.

The DELETE request will receive the deleted webhook as confirmation.

curl -X POST 'https://api.igdb.com/v4/ENDPOINT/webhooks/test/WEBHOOK_ID?entityId=ENTITY_ID' \
-H 'Client-ID: Client ID' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer access_token'
Testing
To make sure you have everything setup just right we have a test endpoint for the webhook service. This endpoint will send an object of your choosing to your newly created webhook.

Send a POST request to ENDPOINT/webhooks/test/WEBHOOK_ID?entityId=ENTITY_ID. The entity id is the id of the object from the endpoint you wish to test with, example:

POST to games/webhooks/test/42?entityId=1337:
This request will send the game object with id 1337 to your webhook url.

Handling Webhooks on your end
When recieveing the webhook message on your end what we expect is to recieve a 200 OK back within 15 seconds. If the endpoint takes longer than 15 seconds to respond the event will be deemed as a failed event, fail 5 times and the webhook will be set to inactive.
