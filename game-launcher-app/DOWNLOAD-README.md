# 🎮 Automated Game Downloads

Your game launcher now has **automatic download functionality** that works seamlessly in the background!

## ✨ What's Been Added

- **Download buttons** on every game (search results, game cards, etc.)
- **Automatic torrent finding** using public APIs
- **Real-Debrid integration** for safe, fast downloads
- **No manual setup required** - everything works automatically!

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Run the setup script:
```bash
node setup-downloads.js
```

### 2. Add your Real-Debrid API key:
1. Go to https://real-debrid.com/apitoken
2. Copy your API token
3. Open the `.env` file that was created
4. Add your token: `REAL_DEBRID_API_KEY=your_token_here`

### 3. That's it! 
Download buttons now work everywhere in your app.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Click any "Download" button** on a game
2. **Automatic search** across multiple torrent sources
3. **Best torrent selected** based on seeders, quality, size
4. **Added to Real-Debrid** automatically
5. **Download from Real-Debrid** using HTTPS (ISP-safe!)

## 🔐 Privacy Protection

- ✅ **No direct torrenting** - your IP never connects to torrent swarms
- ✅ **Only HTTPS traffic** to Real-Debrid (looks like normal web browsing)
- ✅ **No copyright complaints** from your ISP
- ✅ **Legal metadata search** - only finding magnet links, not downloading

## 📱 Where Downloads Appear

Download buttons are now available:
- ✅ **Search results** - Next to each game when you search
- ✅ **Game cards** - Hover over any game card to see download button
- ✅ **Game details** - Full download button in detailed views
- ✅ **Library** - Download games you've added to your library

## 🎯 Download Sources

The system automatically searches:
- **Public DHT networks** - Direct BitTorrent metadata
- **SolidTorrents** - Popular torrent aggregator
- **RARBG mirrors** - High-quality game releases
- **Public APIs** - Various torrent search engines

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration (Optional)

You can customize download behavior in `.env`:

```bash
# Prefer smaller repacks (saves bandwidth)
PREFER_REPACKS=true

# Maximum game size in GB
MAX_GAME_SIZE_GB=50

# Minimum seeders required
MIN_SEEDERS=1

# Auto-download timeout
DOWNLOAD_SERVICE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Download button shows "Failed"
- Check your Real-Debrid API key is correct
- Verify Real-Debrid account has credit/subscription
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### No torrents found
- Try different game name variations
- Some very new or very old games might not be available
- Check if the game name is spelled correctly

### Real-Debrid errors
- Verify your account status at real-debrid.com
- Make sure you have remaining download quota
- Try adding a magnet link manually in Real-Debrid to test

## 📖 Usage Examples

```javascript
// The download service works automatically, but you can also use it programmatically:

import gameDownloadService from './src/services/gameDownloadService';

// Download a game
const result = await gameDownloadService.downloadGame('Cyberpunk 2077');

// Check download status
const status = gameDownloadService.getDownloadStatus(result.downloadId);
```

## 🎉 That's It!

Your game launcher now has **fully automated downloads** that:
- Find torrents automatically
- Protect your privacy
